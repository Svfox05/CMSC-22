a. Test Results

NO. OF GENERATIONS: 1000

RUNTIME W/MULTITHREADING:
1535 ms

RUNTIME W/OUT MULTITHREADING:
112472 ms

b. Applying concurrency in the printGeneration method would theoretically 
improve the speed of printing the next generations of cells, 
reducing the execution runtime of the program.
